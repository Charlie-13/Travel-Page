    <h3>The Plan</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left" ;> Hi my name is Sachin,it was my dream to climb <em><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g1071658-d1220704-Reviews-Kumara_Parvatha-Subramanya_Dakshina_Kannada_District_Karnataka.html">Kumara
          Parvata</a></em> from a long time. One day when I spoke to my friends(Avinash and Shreyas) about the idea to climb the peak, they agreed in an instance.
      We planned all the arrangements and decided a date for the trek.This trek is considered as one of the toughest treks in south India. Total to and fro distance is nearly 26kms.
      I am going to present you the trek experience from here onwards.

    <h3>The Journey</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left" ;>Me and my friends reached <em><a href="https://www.kukke.org/en/home.aspx">Subrahmanya</a></em> town at 5:00 AM on 18th January. After finishing breakfast we went near the base of the hill
      in a auto. We started the trek bt 7:30 AM. In the beginning it was very easy climb. Along the way we met many other people from different places wo came for the trek.
      After climbing for about 3kms we found the water source. We went near the water source for a small break.Again our journey continued. By 11:30 AM we reached <em><a
          href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=bhattara+mane+kumara+parvatha&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-i-Cc_cvpAhUL6XMBHYdgDEEQ_AUoAnoECBEQBA">Bhattara Mane</a></em> which is about 7kms from the base and the only house in that entire hill.
      We finished our lunch in Bhattara Mane.From Bhattara Mane the forest gaurds office is about 200 meteres.We are supposed to pay a basic fee of INR 350rs per person if we want to climb the peak.There is plenty of space for camping near the
      forest gaurds office.
      We pitched our tent nearby and decided to take rest till evening.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left" ;>
      We woke up by 5:00 PM and decided to explore the places nearby. We could witness one of the best sunset of our life from that height.We took some great <em><a href="photoGallery.html" target="_blank">photos</a></em> and roamed nearby.We talked
      about how great the <em><a href="photoGallery.html" target="_blank">peak</a></em> looks from where we stood
      We finished dinner early and decided to sleep early since we were supposed to start the remaining hike by 4:00 AM the next day. After checking the photots which we had taken earlier we slept.

      After the initial checks we started out hike. Since it was dark and cold we did not realise the distance covered. Once the daylight started to fall on greenery we could see how beautiful everyhting looked from there.
      By 6:30 AM we reached the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpagiri_(mountain)">Pushpagiri hill</a></em>which another hill nearby Kumara Parvata peak. The view from Pushpagiri peak was marvellous.We spent almost an hour on
      Pushpagiri peak. The journey from Pushpagiri peak to Kumara Parvata peak is about
      1 KM .
      The path is amidst short trees which is very beautiful and the expeirence is once in a lifetime. We reached the peak by 7:30 AM and there was a feeling of satisfaction in everones heart for being able to reach the top.
      Our journey towards the base began shortly after. We took a break at Bhattara Mane and completed the trek by 3:30 PM. All were tired and we bid goodbye to each other and went our way.
